# Work Sample Exercise – SDM, Customer Experience (3–5 hrs)

## Goal
Build a working prototype that summarizes multi-threaded CE emails and integrates into a workflow with an edit/approve step. You should at minimum cover the flow from raw email threads → NLP summarization → human approval → usable output for associates. How you choose to design and prototype this is up to you.

## Requirements
- Mandatory prototype (automation tools or custom stack).
- NLP summarization approach (API, OSS model, or rules-based).
- Workflow integration with CRM context.
- Show edit/approve step.

## Deliverables
- Prototype link or repo (important: we value concise code).
- Brief notes (important: <1 page) on stack, NLP choice, scaling plan.
- Use dataset: ce_exercise_threads.json

## Evaluation
- Prototype quality & coding depth
- NLP usefulness/faithfulness
- Workflow usability for CE associates
- Judgment (automation tools vs custom; scale-up path)
- Outcome thinking (time saved, CSAT, EBITDA)

## Tips
- NLP summarization can be basic, but structured thinking is encouraged.
- Focus on creating some flow rather than the perfect flow. If there are areas of improvement, call them out in the documentation.
